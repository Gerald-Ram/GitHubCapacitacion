# This file follows a set of common config conventions and should be self-explanatory.
# All of the supported options are listed below and are commented out with a leading
# semicolon.  To set an options, uncomment the appropriate line and set the value as
# required.
#
# The precedence ordering for settings is
#
#   1. Command line arguments
#   2. The config file (this file)
#   3. Application defaults
#
# i.e. command line arguments override the config file and application defaults, and
# the config file overrides application defaults.
#
# To use this config file, run the client with the command line argument
#   --config-file="/path/to/this/file"
#
# To check the validity of the config file run the client with the command line arguments
#   --check --config-file="/path/to/this/file"
# All non zero exit codes indicate a problem.  Details about the error are printed to stdout.

[settings]
# The client stores settings, logs and downloads in a settings folder.
# This defaults to ~/.printnode on POSIX systems and %HOMEPATH%/.printnode on Windows.
#
# Unless you are doing something exotic, such as running multiple instances of the client
# on a single machine under a single user, you almost certainly don't want to modify
# the defaults in this section.
